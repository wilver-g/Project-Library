# Library Book Entry Project

The Library Book Entry Project is a simple web application that allows users to enter and catalog book details using a form. The goal of this project is to provide a straightforward example of how to create an interactive interface for managing a collection of books in a library.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The project features a button that users can click to open a form where they can input book details.

- **Book Details:** Users can enter the book's title, author, and the number of pages in the provided form.

- **Data Storage:** The entered book details are stored in an array within the JavaScript code.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to serve as an educational example for those learning web development. It showcases the fundamental concepts of handling user input, managing data, and creating a basic interactive web interface.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use

Since this project is intended as an example, there are no specific usage instructions. However, you can clone the repository and explore the code to understand how the interface is created and how the book details are stored.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the project provides a basic demonstration, there are several ways it could be expanded or enhanced:

- **Persistent Storage:** Implement a backend or local storage solution to persistently store the entered book details.

- **Additional Fields:** Add more fields to the form, such as publication date, genre, and a brief description.

- **Dynamic UI:** Improve the user interface by dynamically updating the displayed book collection as new books are added.
